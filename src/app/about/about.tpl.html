    The Elevator Pitch
    <small>For the lazy and impatient.</small>
  </h1>
  <p>
    <code>ng-mau</code> is an opinionated kickstarter for web
    development projects. It's an attempt to create a simple starter for new
    web sites and apps: just download it and start coding. The goal is to
    have everything you need to get started out of the box; of course it has
    slick styles and icons, but it also has a best practice directory structure
    to ensure maximum code reuse. And it's all tied together with a robust
    build system chock-full of some time-saving goodness.

  <h2>Why?</h2>

  <p>
    Because my team and I make web apps, and 
    last year AngularJS became our client-side framework of choice. We start
    websites the same way every time: create a directory structure, copy and
    ever-so-slightly tweak some config files from an older project, and yada
    yada, etc., and so on and so forth. Why are we repeating ourselves? We wanted a starting point; a set of
    best practices that we could identify our projects as embodying and a set of
    time-saving wonderfulness, because time is money.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are other similar projects out there, but none of them suited our
    needs. Some are awesome but were just too much, existing more as reference
    implementations, when we really just wanted a kickstarter. Others were just
    too little, with puny build systems and unscalable architectures.  So we
    designed <code>ng-mau</code> to be just right.
